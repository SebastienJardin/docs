Some customers might encounter troubles with the quota on ETCD storage usage.

## Issue

When you want to manage an objects into your Kubernetes cluster, you can reached an error like this:

```log
"Error from server: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ETCD storage quota exceeded"
```

Each Kubernetes cluster have a dedicated quota on ETCD storage.

The formula to calculate ETCD quota allowed is: *Total = 10MB + (25MB per node)*

For a cluster with 3 servers "b2-7" the quota are : 85MB

Don't worry about the decrease, you keep the max quotas allowed forever, to prevent shrink of datas.

## Troubleshoot

### Cert-Manager

The first mostfull usecase is come from with a bad configuration on [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)

Most users install the cert-manager from Helm, and take a quick road to prod it.

If cert-manager have a bad configuration, he try to create unlimited number of certificare requets.

The operator cert-manager going to satured all empty allow storage in ETCD.

To detect that, you can find the number of certificate-requets:

```bash
kubectl get certificaterequests -A | wc -l
```

If you have a huge number of certificate request (+1000 for example), you have find the root cause !

To solve that,we propose this way:

* Stop the operator cert-manager

```bash
kubectl scale deployment --replicas 0 cert-manager
```

* flush all useless certificate request

```bash
kubectl get 

// TODO a fixer

kubectl get certificates --all-namespaces -o json \
    | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status.phase == "Pending").metadata.namespace' \
    | parallel kubectl -n '{}' delete po -l 'component=kube-controller-manager'
```

* Update cert-manager

There is no generic way to do this, but if you use Helm we recommend you to use it for the update.
[Cert Manager official documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/)

* Fix the issue

We recommend you to take the following steps to troubleshoot your cert-manager, and to ensure that everything is correctly configured:
[Acme troubleshoot](https://cert-manager.io/docs/faq/acme/)

* Start cert-manager

### Other usecase

If cert-manager is not the root causes, you should turn to the other running operators.

We have found that the following resources can sometimes be generated continuously by existing operators:
> backups.velero.io
ingress.networking.k8s.io
ingress.extensions

If that still  does not cover your case, you can use a tool like [ketall](https://github.com/corneliusweig/ketall) to easily list and count resources in your cluster.
